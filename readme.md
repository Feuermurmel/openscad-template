# OpenSCAD Template

## Repository structure

This repository, as it is maintained on 
[GitHub](http://github.com/Feuermurmel/openscad-template), contains two
important branches, `master` and `examples`. `master` contains an empty project 
which is ready to be cloned and used for new project.

Branch `examples` additionally contains a few example source files which are 
ready to be compiled. The root directory on that branch also contains a second 
text document `examples.creole`, describing the example project in more detail.


## Prerequisites

- OpenSCAD snapshot > 2014.11.05
    - Used to compile OpenSCAD source files to STL.
    - A recent development snapshot is recommended, e.g. version 2014.11.05 or 
      later.
        - The current release version (2014.03) generates invalid dependency 
          information if the path to the project contains spaces or other 
          characters that need to be treated specially in a makefile and also 
          has trouble with 2D shapes containing holes. The current development 
          version solves these problems.

- Inkscape > 0.91
    - Used to export DXF files to SVG.
    - Recommended to edit SVG files, especially if importing of separate layers 
      in OpenSCAD is needed.
    - At least version 0.91 (or maybe some earlier development snapshot) is 
      necessary because the command line verbs used to transform and massage an 
      SVG prior to export have only recently been added.

- Python 2.7
    - Used for to run the plugin that exports DXF to SVG and to run scripts 
      that wrap the OpenSCAD command line tool and work around problems with 
      generation of dependency information in OpenSCAD.
    - Should already be installed as a dependency to Inkscape. The most recent 
      version of Python 2.7 is recommended.

- Asymptote [0]
    - Used to compile Asymptote files to PDF.
    - Recommended when creating Vector cutting projects for Epilog laser 
    cutters.

[0]: This project was tested with Asymptote Version 2.35. Earlier Versions will 
     probably also work.


### Explicitly specifying paths to binaries

If any of the required binaries is not available on `$PATH` or a different 
version should be used, the paths to these binaries can be configured by 
creating a file called `config.mk` in the same directory as the makefile. 
There, variables can be set to the absolute or relative paths to these 
binaries. For example:

    # Path to the OpenSCAD binary
    OPENSCAD := /Applications/OpenSCAD.app/Contents/MacOS/OpenSCAD
    
    # Path to the Inkscape binary
    INKSCAPE := /opt/local/bin/inkscape
    
    # Path to the Python 2.7 binary
    PYTHON := /opt/local/bin/python2.7
    
    # Path to the Asymptote binary
    ASYMPTOTE := /opt/local/bin/asy


## Supported file types

### Using SVG files from OpenSCAD

Any file whose name ends in `.svg` may be used from an OpenSCAD file like this:

    import("file.dxf");

The makefile will automatically convert the SVG file to a DXF file when 
building the project. If Inkscape is used to edit the SVG file, multiple layers 
can be created which can then be imported individually:

    import("file.dxf", "background");

The DXF export supports all shapes supported by Inkscape (e.g. rectangles,
circles, paths, spiro lines, text, â€¦). Before the objects are exported, all 
objects are converted to paths and combined using the union operation. For 
objects which have a stroke style, the stroke instead of the filled area is 
converted to a path. Then, the resulting path is converted to a set of line 
segments which closely follow the curved parts of the path. The resulting line 
segments are exported to DXF and combined to the original shapes when imported 
in OpenSCAD. For these transformations to work, the objects need to be placed 
in Inkscape layers.

OpenSCAD itself does not define which unit is used to measure lengths [1]. 
Inkscape OTOH allows the user to define a document wide unit as well as using
different units when specifying the size and position of shapes. When exporting 
the SVG document using Inkscape, all numbers are converted to the unit 
specified under _General_ in Inkscape's _Document Properties_ dialog. These 
numbers are the written to the DXF document and used OpenSCAD directly.

DXF and OpenSCAD both use a right-handed coordinate system (the Y axis runs up 
while the X-axis runs to the right). While SVG uses a left-handed coordinate 
system (the Y axis runs down instead). But Inkscape, surprisingly, also uses a 
right-handed coordinate system. The DXF export script honors this and places 
the origin of the document in the lower left corner when exporting the 
document.

[1]: Although millimeters seems to be the predominant unit.


### Using SVG files from Asymptote

SVG files may instead be used from Asymptote files. For each SVG file, an 
Asymptote file of the same name is generated. These files can be imported as 
modules from other Asymptote files. These modules will contain a member of 
type `path[]` for each layer in the original SVG file:

    import test;
    
    draw(test.Layer_1, red + 0.001mm);

The module also contains a member `all`, which just contains all paths in one 
array.


### OpenSCAD files

Files whose names end in `.scad` are compiled to STL files using OpenSCAD. 
OpenSCAD files whose name start with `_` are treated as "library" files which 
will not be compiled to STL files. These files can still be used from other 
OpenSCAD files using one of the following commands:

    include <filename>
    use <filename>

Please see the 
[OpenSCAD User Manual](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Print_version) 
for details this and other OpenSCAD functionality.


## Generating Source files

This template includes support for automatically generated source files. This 
works by editing the `generate_sources.sh` script.

The script defines a function `generate_file()`, which should be called in the 
remainder of the script once for each file to generate. The first argument to 
the function is be the name of the file. The remaining arguments are treated as 
a command, which, when run, should output the file's content to standard 
output. For example:

    generate_file "src/cube.scad" echo "cube(25);"

How the function `generate_file()` is called is up to the script and may e.g. 
be done from a `for` loop or while iterating over a set of other source files.


## Compiling

To compile the whole project, run `make` from the directory in which this 
readme is. This will generate all sources files, if any, process all SVG files 
and produce an STL file for each OpenSCAD source file whose name does not start 
with `_`. Individual files may be created or updated by passing their names to 
the make command, as usual.


### Makefile targets

These are the special makefile targets which can be used in addition to the 
names of individual files to update:

- `all`: Builds all files that can be built from any source files. This is the 
default target when running `make` without arguments.
- `clean`: Removes all built files [2].
- `generated`: Generates all files generated by `generate_sources.sh`.
- `dxf`: Exports all SVG files to DXF files.
- `stl`: Compiles all OpenSCAD files to STL files.
- `asy`: Exports all configured SVG files to Asymptote files.
- `pdf`: Compiles all Asymptote files to PDF files.

[2]: This will not remove files for which the source file was removed. There is 
no simple way to detect whether a file was previously built from a source file 
or if it placed in the `src` directory manually.


### Settings used for compilation

The quality of the DXF export can be specified by creating a file called 
`settings.mk` in the same directory as the makefile. Setting `DXF_FLATNESS` to 
a smaller value (which defaults to `0.1`) creates a shape that more closely 
follows curved parts of the exported shapes. For example:

    # Specify how far the exported approximation may deviate from the actual 
    # shape. The default is 0.1.
    DXF_FLATNESS := 0.02
    
    # Specify which SVG files should be exported to Asymptote files instead of 
    # DXF files. By default, this list is empty.
    ASYMPTOTE_EXPORTED_SVG_FILES := src/example.svg


### Dependency tracking

OpenSCAD has the ability to write dependency files which record all files used 
while producing an STL file. These dependency files can be read by `make`. This 
ability is used to only recompile necessary files when running make.

This same mechanism is currently not used for converting SVG files referring to 
other files or for the script used to generate source files. Therefore, if 
other file used in the process are changed, the corresponding source files 
tracked by the makefile (the main SVG files or the files `generate_sources.sh` 
in case of generated sources) needs to be manually marked as changes by calling
 `touch` on the file before calling `make`.

For Asymptote files, a safer approach is currently taken. If any of the 
Asymptote source files in the `src` directory are changed, all Asymptote source 
files are recompiled.
